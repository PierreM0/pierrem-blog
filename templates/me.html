	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>Fan of Rust, and university student in France in computer science. I learn programming because it's fun, and i feel like it's like playing a good video-game<p>
	<p>I mostly do system and back-end programming, due to the fact that I'm not a great designer, and I never felt like I had a great video-game idea.</p>
